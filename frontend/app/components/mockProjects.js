      title: "VIS4AI: Visual analytics for explainable Large Vision Language Models",
      summary: "Existing large vision language models often work like a blackbox. There are a really large number of parameters in the large vision language models. This project aims to develop an interactive visual analytics approach to explain which set of parameters are responsible for specific functions or concepts and how the large vision language models work.",

      summary: "For Large Language Models(LLMs), besides ChatGPT whose source-code is not publicly released, there are also some open-sourced LLMs like miniGPT-4, llava, mPlug-OWL, Otter and InstructLib. There are a really large number of parameters in the LLMs, and their detailed parameters are actually accessible. So one question to ask ourselves is: can we explain which set of parameters are responsible for specific functions or concepts?",

      summary: "Generative AI (GAI) is expected to improve transportation services by suggesting users the best modes of transportation to travel among places. This project will develop a system of mobile personalized transportation service that a user can specific travel requirements such as origins, multiple destinations, time, and other requirements (e.g., bus or train preferences), and the system will generate the best travel plans for the users. Generative AI technologies such as large language models (LLMs) and Stable Diffusion can be used to support the system.",

One hundred years ago the theremin was invented. This is an electronic musical instrument controlled without physical contact by hands of the performer. The theremin consists of two metal antennas that sense the relative position of the thereminist's hands and control pitch of the notes with one hand, and volume with the other.",

How do we come up with AI models capable of predicting human eye movements? Students get to program computational models of eye movement predictions. Alternatively, students also get to learn how to use advanced eye tracking devices in the lab, design eye tracking expeirments with programming languages, collecting human data, and analyzing these eye movement data.",
